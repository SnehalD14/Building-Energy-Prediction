        <p style="color:black; font-size:15px"; class="padding";>  In this website, we present our work towards Predicting the Energy Consumption of a Building using four different Machine Learning techniques. Our aim is to compare the results from various techniques and explore the effects of data manipulation. This work is based on the running Kaggle competition "ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III". Further information about the competition can be obtained on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data">Kaggle</a> website. Additionally, the dataset used can be found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data">Kaggle Dataset</a>

    <div> 
    	<p>As cities become more crowded, it has become important to efficiently use ground space by building taller buildings for office spaces and homes. However, these buildings are difficult to heat and cool, and it is becoming increasingly expensive to maintain them. In recent years, there have been many advances to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, such as cool roofs, high-quality insulation, and smart appliances to regulate temperatures. The challenge here is is retroactively calculating how much energy a building would consume without these additions. This calculation will help building owners better understand the improvements from the additions, and will provide energy companies with accurate data to convince others to implement energy-saving modifiers.</p>
	    <p>The function of this tool is to predict the energy consumed by a building without any retrofits and motivate large scale investors to witness the usefulness of these improvements. This tool will take into account building specifications(size, year built, number of floors) and weather conditions (air temperature, wind speed, wind direction) to predict the energy consumed without using energy saving advancements.</p>

<div> <p>Our goal is to build a model that predicts a building's energy usage per meter.
We are given a dataset of energy meter readings of 1450 buildings over three years. Each building has an identifier (building id), square footage, primary use, year built, floor count, and a site id that connects each building to weather conditions measured in the area. Each meter reading contains a timestamp, meter type, and energy consumption in kWh. Different buildings might have different meters installed. Some of them have only one type of meter, some have all four.
Each reading is also connected to a weather reading with properties such as cloud coverage, air temperature, and wind speed because energy consumption is closely tied to atmospheric temperature and pressure.</p>

<p>We approached this problem with the following steps.</p></div>
<li>Perform exploratary analysis on the data</li>
<li>Transfer features</li>
<li>Fill missing values</li>
<li>Apply four machine-learning algorithms</li>

	<h5><u>Handling Missing Values</u></h5> 
	<div>We began by analysing the data for missing values and plotting the amount of data available in the training and test sets.</div>
    	<img src="images/missing data.png" alt="Missing Data" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></img>
	<div> Parameters such as floor_count, year_built and cloud_coverage were missing at least 50% of values and were dropped. 
	The missing values in the remaining features, other than timestamp, were filled with median values of the feature due to outliers.
	The missing values in Timestamp were filled with mean.</div>
	<h5><u>Exploratary Data Analysis</u></h5>
	<div>To understand the effect of dropping features, we plotted the correlation between all features. We found that the meter reading was most closely related to the building id and site id, and moderately related to square footage and cloud coverage. Intuitively this makes sense because a given building will be fairly consistent in energy consumption. Additionally, the size of the building and the amount of sun available will be important.</div>
	<img src="images/Correlation.png" alt="Cor" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></img>
	<div> On analyzing the data further, we found some an unexpected variance in a few features. This led us to search for outliers to exclude. </div>
	<img src="images/min max.png" alt="min" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></img>
	<h5><u>Feature Normalization</u></h5>
	<div>We also performed the following conversions.:
	 	<li>Square feet to log(square feet)</li>
		<li>Degrees to 16 compass directions for wind direction</li>
		<li>Wind Speed to beaufort scale (wind speed to observed conditions at land)</li>
		<li>Timestamp to week and hour of day.</li>
		<li>We encoded the rest of the data using one-hot encoding</li>

For each algorithm, we initially split the given training data randomly into a training and testing set. Once the model was trained and tested to satisfaction, we then used it to predict outcomes for Kaggles "secret" testing data and obtained our final results.
