# Building Energy Prediction 
Website: https://snehald14.github.io/Building_Energy_Prediction/

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data

## Instructions 
1) The Code Folder in this repository includes codes in .ipynb format for all the models. The codes can were run on Google Colab. To run the code in Juypter Notebook, get rid of the drive mounting lines in the code and check the path of the folder containing the dataset in your system. 

2) In case you intend to run the code on a server (like Turning), perform set (1) and convert the code to .py file.

3) The Neural Network code was tested with Tensorflow 2.0 and throws errors with an earlier version.

4)All the codes output a submissions.csv file which is in the format of submissions for the Kaggle Competition
